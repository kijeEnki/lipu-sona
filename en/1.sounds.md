toki pona has 14 letters in its alphabet:

a e i k j l m n o p s t u w

## general guide to pronounciation
### vowels
the vowels are similar to spanish.

a \[ä\] - like **a** in f**a**ther

e \[e̞\] - like **e** in l**e**t or t**e**n

i \[i\] - like **ee** in b**ee**

o \[o̞\] - like **o** in c**o**ne

u \[u\] - like **oo** in s**oo**n

(note that the comparisons to english words are approximations and may not be accurate depending on your accent, i recommend going by the IPA symbols inside the square brackets for a more accurate idea of the correct pronunciations)

### consonants
most of the consonants are just like english, except j. j is always like y in yellow

### stress
don't be stressed, you don't have to pronounce the letters exactly as i say, you can pronounce things slightly differently if it feels natural - for example, you could soften your p, t, and k sounds into b, d, and g sounds!

oh and also, you always have to stress the first syllable of every word.

<!-- translation note: this is a silly joke where i conflate stress as in the emotion and stress as in word stress. this might not work in your translation, and it might be smart to split this up into two separate sections, one for noting the freedom in pronunciation and one for the rule about stress. but its up to u -->
