<!-- ## ??/??/????
- added audio to the vocab sections. click words to hear how it's pronounced! 
    - this change was applied to all translations too.
    - in the future i may add audio to example sentences too. 
- added explanations to all the words, to expand on and clarify usage that might not be clear just from the shorter keyword-style definition.
    - also added a dictionary page, where all definitions and explanations can be seen on one page.
-->

## 20/11/2024
- course was moved to lipu-sona.comforttiger.space
- my name has been soweli Sika for a while now, now its finally soweli Sika in here also
- also made a small change to the introduction

## 08/09/2024
- added a little special thanks section to the frontpage. i thank all the people that made this course and its translations possible!
- changed *toki Wensa* to *toki Sensa*
    - multiple swedes have said that *toki Sensa* makes more sense to them
    - i still wanted the example to highlight how there are always multiple possibilites, so i mention that it *could* be *toki Wensa* instead.
- changed "obey me - o kute e mi" example to "listen to me - o kute e mi"
    - it doesn't really make sense to teach that kute = obey. it's more nuanced than that.
- added some extra little lessons. these aren't part of the main course, they're just little lessons i wanted to write about different topics that don't fit in the main course.
    - for now there is one about nasin nanpa pona, and one about nasin sitelen kalama and nasin sitelen kalama pi linja lili. i'd like to add more later.
- i added little disclaimers to a few different pages of the course, that cover ways in which the style i teach differs from many others' style. for now, i have the following disclaimers:
    - different ways to think about modifiers (lesson 3)
    - i turned the note about punctuation into a disclaimer (lesson 4)
    - preverbs i dont teach about - alasa, open, pini (lesson 5)
    - transitive verb kepeken (lesson 7)
    - sentence inital kin (lesson 14)
    - words i've not covered in this course (lesson 20)

## 17/05/2024
- did some small formatting changes to how example sentences are formatted
    - i also made it easier for me to make small formatting changes to example sentences in the future
    - every translation received this change too
- i now introduce and explain ijo much earlier, in lesson 2
    - there's now a note about ijo in lesson 2 instead. this note is similar to but a little shorter than the previous note about inclusivity in lesson 9. i'd like to make it even shorter at some point
- updated a lot of vocabulary definitions
    - new definitions are based on linku's ongoing definition rework, with slight changes to some definitions by me.

## 24/03/2024
- changed the "mi mute li wawa" example in lesson 3 to "mi sin li wawa"

## 23/03/2024
- added definitions from lipamanka's toki pona dictionary to the vocab sections. click the words to see a more detailed explanation of the words!
- added a small clarification about prepositions being stackable to lesson 7 - prepositions
- made a changelog so i can keep track of things that have changed
