## lesson
:word[󱥄 o] has three different functions - commands, wishes/desires, and addressing people.

### commands
:word[󱥄 o] can be used before a predicate, with no subject, to express a command.

::example
󱥄 :predicate[󱤶󱥔] \
o :predicate[moku pona]
#translation
:predicate[eat well!] <br>
:predicate[have a nice meal!]
::

### wishes and desires

:word[󱥄 o] can replace :word[󱤧 li] to express a wish or desire.

::example
:subject[󱤑] 󱥄 :predicate[󱥔] \
:subject[jan] o :predicate[pona]
#translation
:subject[people] :predicate[should be good]
::

when used with :word[󱤴 mi] or :word[󱥞 sina], you still have to include :word[󱥄 o], even though you would omit :word[󱤧 li].

::example
:subject[󱤴] 󱥄 :predicate[󱤢] \
:subject[mi] o :predicate[lape]
#translation
:subject[i] :predicate[should sleep]
::

### addressing others
you can put :word[󱥄 o] after a subject to address them.

::example
:subject[󱥴] 󱥄 \
:subject[waso] o
#translation
hey :subject[bird!]
::

::example
:subject[󱥢󱦐󱥦󱤌󱤑󱤄󱤧󱤂󱦑] 󱥄󱦜󱥞󱥡󱤂󱥡󱥬󱦖󱥔 \
